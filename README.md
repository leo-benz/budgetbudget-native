# BudgetBudget
An implementation of [BudgetBudget](https://github.com/Xiphe/budgetbudget) using the native Apple technology stack.

The goal is to reimplement the functionality as a macOS app using Swift and SwiftUI and provide the app for both macOS and iOS (without the MoneyMoney sync).

This project is in early development and not usable yet.

## Contributions
Contributions in the form of pull requests and issues are welcome. 
Since the project is under active development it would be great to announce your contribution beforehand to avoid duplicate implementations of the same feature.
